# Maybe Logic

A framework for holding beliefs lightly, practicing epistemic humility, and maintaining cognitive flexibility in the face of uncertainty.

## Description

Maybe logic is the disciplined practice of replacing certainty with probability, acknowledging the limits of knowledge, and keeping beliefs provisional. It recognizes that "maybe" is often the most honest word in any language. This approach treats beliefs as tools to be picked up, used, and set down rather than truths to be defended. Maybe logic protects against the cognitive calcification that comes from excessive certainty while still allowing effective action.

## When to Use
- When you catch yourself becoming dogmatic about any position
- When evaluating claims that trigger strong certainty or rejection
- When mediating between people with opposing convictions
- When making decisions under genuine uncertainty
- When your beliefs are causing you suffering or conflict
- When you need to remain open to new information
- When navigating domains where experts disagree
- When someone challenges a belief you've held for years



## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Notice Certainty

Become aware of absolute language in your thinking:

- "This IS true" becomes "This SEEMS true to me now"
- "They ARE wrong" becomes "Their view doesn't fit my current model"
- "Obviously..." becomes "From my perspective..."
- "Everyone knows..." becomes "Many people in my context believe..."

Flag any thought that claims certainty. Certainty is almost always an exaggeration.

### Step 2: Assess Your Evidence

For any belief you hold strongly, ask:

- What is my actual evidence for this?
- How reliable is this evidence?
- What is the evidence against this belief?
- What would change my mind?
- How many times have I been certain about something and later wrong?

Be honest. Most beliefs are held for reasons other than evidence: social belonging, emotional comfort, cognitive habit, authority, tradition.

### Step 3: Calibrate Probability

Replace binary true/false with probability estimates:

- "Definitely true" (100%) becomes "Very likely true" (85-95%)
- "Probably true" (70-85%)
- "More true than false" (55-70%)
- "Uncertain" (45-55%)
- "Probably false" (30-45%)
- "Very likely false" (5-15%)

No belief deserves 100% or 0%. Reality is more complex than any model. Leave room for surprise.

### Step 4: Hold Beliefs as Tools

Reconceptualize what beliefs are for:

- A belief is useful if it helps you navigate reality effectively
- A belief is harmful if it makes you rigid, cruel, or blind
- The test of a belief is not "Is it TRUE?" but "Is it USEFUL?"
- You can use a model without believing in it absolutely
- Multiple incompatible models can all be useful in different contexts

Ask: "What does this belief let me do? What does it prevent me from seeing?"

### Step 5: Practice Dialectical Thinking

For any position you hold:

- Argue the opposite position as if you believed it
- Find the valid insight inside views you reject
- Look for the synthesis that includes both thesis and antithesis
- Notice when you're defending your identity rather than seeking truth
- Celebrate when evidence forces you to update

The goal is not to have no position but to hold positions lightly, ready to revise.

### Step 6: Embrace "I Don't Know"

Cultivate comfort with uncertainty:

- "I don't know" is a complete and respectable answer
- Not knowing is not failure; pretending to know is
- Some questions may be permanently undecidable
- Uncertainty is not weakness; false certainty is
- The most interesting questions are the ones without clear answers

Practice saying "I don't know" when you don't. It's harder than it sounds.

## Examples of Application

### Example 1: Political Beliefs

**Before maybe logic:** "The other party is destroying the country. Their policies are obviously harmful. Anyone who supports them is either evil or stupid."

**After maybe logic:** "I strongly prefer my party's policies based on values I hold. I might be wrong about the consequences of either set of policies. Intelligent people disagree, which suggests this is genuinely complex. The other side is probably responding to real problems I'm not fully seeing. I'll advocate for my views while remaining open to evidence that I'm mistaken."

**Result:** Reduced tribalism, better ability to understand opponents, lower stress, more productive conversations.

### Example 2: Personal Decisions

**Before maybe logic:** "I need to take this job / marry this person / move to this city. This is THE right choice. Any doubt means I'm not committed enough."

**After maybe logic:** "This seems like a good choice given what I know now. I can't predict the future. The alternative paths might have been good too. I'll make this choice fully while remaining open to changing course if it doesn't work out. Uncertainty isn't disloyalty; it's honesty."

**Result:** Less decision paralysis, reduced regret (since you acknowledged uncertainty upfront), greater adaptability.

### Example 3: Interpersonal Conflict

**Before maybe logic:** "They're clearly wrong. I saw what happened. They're lying or deluded. I know I'm right."

**After maybe logic:** "I have my perception of what happened. They have theirs. Memory is reconstructive and unreliable. I'm probably missing context they have. We might both be describing the same events through different frames. What if I'm the one who misperceived?"

**Result:** Reduced righteousness, more curiosity about the other person's experience, better chance of resolution.

### Example 4: Expertise and Authority

**Before maybe logic:** "The experts say X, so X must be true" or "The experts are all corrupt/wrong, so I'll believe the opposite."

**After maybe logic:** "Expert consensus is evidence worth weighing, but experts have been wrong before. I'll consider their views seriously while noting: What is their actual evidence? What incentives might bias them? Where do experts disagree? What would falsify their claims?"

**Result:** Neither naive trust nor reflexive dismissal. Better calibrated confidence in expert claims.

## Key Principles

1. **"Maybe" is the most honest word** - The universe doesn't deal in certainties. Our knowledge is always incomplete. "Maybe" leaves room for reality to surprise you.

2. **Belief is a tool, not a truth** - Beliefs are instruments for navigating reality. Like any tool, they should be evaluated by their usefulness, maintained carefully, and replaced when broken.

3. **Certainty is a performance** - When you feel certain, you're not accessing truth directly; you're experiencing a psychological state. That state can be triggered by many things other than evidence.

4. **Strong opinions, weakly held** - You can act decisively while remaining open to revision. Commitment to a course of action doesn't require certainty that it's correct.

5. **Your past self was wrong about many things** - You've changed your mind before. You'll change it again. Your current beliefs are not the final word. Humility follows from honestly reviewing your own track record.

6. **Intelligence includes knowing what you don't know** - The smartest people are often the most uncertain because they understand complexity. Dunning-Kruger works in both directions.

7. **Maybe logic is not wishy-washy relativism** - You can still act, advocate, and commit. You just do so while acknowledging uncertainty, remaining open to evidence, and treating opponents as potentially having valid insights rather than being simply wrong.

8. **The goal is flexibility, not paralysis** - Maybe logic should make you more effective, not less. If your uncertainty is preventing action, you're overcorrecting. Act on your best current model while remaining ready to update.
